## PLAIT Lab Reading Group

The PLAIT Lab Reading Group is a casual meeting that we have once a week,
ideally over lunch. We usually either discuss a recently published paper or talk
about our own works in progress.

### Summer 2021

During this term, we focused on two types of readings we don't usually discuss
in the reading group:

1. **<u>P</u>**rogramming **<u>L</u>**anguages **<u>P</u>**relim
   readings from the UC Berkeley list of recommended readings to prepare for the
   PhD preliminary examination in programming languages
1. **<u>E</u>**ducation readings
